Flux caused errors if I do "flux run xxx >& ${LOG}".
- larger stdout with longer runs: it hangs at some point and lose the stdout
- even with smaller output with ~25MB: it duplicated. repeated the same stdout twice in a single file
  -> it caused wrong thing in monitor.sh as it was assuming sequentially increasing traj.
  
The 2nd issue seems resolved by using "flux run --output=${LOG}" instead.
Previously generated logfiles were reinvestigated.

- nf0: occured so many times, updated monitor.sh to deals with this without modifying log files, and re-run this script.
- nf1: too many logs exist, but assuming didn't happen that much. checked using check_fluxstdouterr_duplication.sh,
       and found the 3 of faulty logs. Including 2 additional things that I found previously using monitor.sh.
       Anyway these are manually fixed, and the originals are conserved with _log.xx as follows.
