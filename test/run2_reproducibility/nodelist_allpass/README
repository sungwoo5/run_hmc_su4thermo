* found that previously made nodelist for runs on 100724 included the runs that didn't go through the test at the end due to the wallclock time limit.
Therefore, those runs are not actually passed the reproducibility test.
Here, I re-scan the runs to get the correct nodelist

* log_didntpass.txt:
they are all canceled in the middle of runs, so didn't even enter into the test,
so they are not failed actuallly but should be neglected in the passed nodelist
